# Self-RAG-Chatbot
# Contextual Chatbot with Local Deployment  

This project involves the development of a contextual chatbot designed to maintain conversation flow and provide accurate, context-aware responses. Powered by the **Llama 3 8B** model, the chatbot utilizes **Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SELF-RAG)** to enhance the accuracy and factual reliability of its outputs. By employing **LangGraph**, a graph-based conversational framework, the system efficiently manages multi-turn conversations and retains context dynamically.  

Key features include:  
- **Local Deployment:** Operates entirely on a local machine to ensure privacy and eliminate reliance on external servers.  
- **Advanced Retrieval Mechanism:** Uses vector-based storage and semantic retrieval for precise information retrieval.  
- **Document Parsing and Chunking:** Processes large documents into manageable chunks for efficient response generation.  

This chatbot represents a robust, privacy-focused solution for secure and intelligent conversational AI.
